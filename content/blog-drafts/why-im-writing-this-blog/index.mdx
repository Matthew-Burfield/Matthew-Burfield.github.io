## Introduction

A lot of the blogs I aspire to have origin stories.

## My Developer Journey

My developer journey started in the last week of my university Bachelor degree. I was cramming last minute for one of my final exams before graduating, pulling an all-nighter. It was 2am, my eye lids were getting heavy, and had just downed a can of V energy drink, which feels like an oxymoron, but I was pretty much running on fumes at that point.

I was about to complete a bachelor of applied science at QUT, majoring in physics - and I had no idea what I was going to do after graduating. Mostly, as a cohort, we were getting pushed towards doing an honours year and a research paper, but that just led to a PhD and I didn't see myself having a research career. The only reason I was studying physics in the first place is because I liked my physics teacher in high school.

So there I was, 2am in the morning, sitting at the computer cramming for a final exam, with a looming anxiety of not knowing what to do after graduation.

Sounds like a good time for a quick break. :sweat_smile:

Naturally I found myself on YouTube, browsing through random videos when I stumbled across a video which talked about the different jobs there are in creating video games. Once such role was the physics engine creator. A role where you used mathematic algorithms to simulate real world factors like gravity and Newton's laws of motion in virtual worlds - holy shit! I think I just discovered what I wanted to do with my life!

Doing a little research, I found I could get a Masters degree in IT in only 18 months, as the only requirement was the Bachelor degree that I had just obtained. With some supportive parents backing me, I was back at uni again.

Most of the Masters degree was just course work, it pretty much felt like the first have of a Bachelor of IT and in fact, I was literally in the same classes as the Bachelor students! I didn't understand how the university could even call it a Masters degree as I though the Masters was supposed to be more advanced!? I didn't really care though, I would take the certificate and be on my way.

I did really enjoy the course work though, I remember going into uni on the weekends and happily spending all day working through my coding assignments.

In the final semester of my course I had the opportunity to work at a company full-time as part of my course work. I would have to drop down to two

## Conclusion

Happy Coding!
