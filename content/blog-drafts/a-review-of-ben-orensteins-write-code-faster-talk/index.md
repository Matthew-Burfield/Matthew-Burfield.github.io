# Conclusion

I'm really happy I did this Chingu Voyage. It was a great motivator and kept me
accountable. I also enjoyed working as the PM, organising the tasks for each
member and checking in with everyone indiviually.

I plan to keep working on the wedding registry and get it to a point that it could
be used in the real world.

After that, I'll definitely be back to do another Voyage!
