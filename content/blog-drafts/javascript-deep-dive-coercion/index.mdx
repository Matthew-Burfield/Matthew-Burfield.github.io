Quote from YDKJS

> In the same overall spirit of this series, rather than running away from coercion because everyone else does, or because you get bitten by some quirk, I think you should run toward that which you don’t understand and seek to get it more fully.

> Converting a value from one type to another is often called “type casting,” when done explicitly, and “coercion” when done implicitly (forced by the rules of how a value is used).

Happy Coding!
