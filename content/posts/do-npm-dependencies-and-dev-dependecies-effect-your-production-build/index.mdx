#### An introduction

A question I often ask myself when installing new npm packages in my projects is
what's the difference between `dependencies` and `devDependencies` in your
`package.json` file. Further to that, is there any difference in how they're
handled between `Yarn` and `NPM`? If I uneccessarily add modules as `dependencies`
when they could be `devDependencies` what will happen? And visa-versa, what
happens if I accedentally install as a `devDependency` when it needs to be a
`dependency`?  Will my deployments break? Will my build bundle get bloated?

These are the questions I want answered. And they're the answers you'll find in
this post.

#### `yarn install` vs `npm install`

Looking at the documentation for both Yarn and NPM, their install commands work
the same way in terms of dependencies and devDependencies.

When using `yarn install` and `npm install`, both Yarn and NPM will install all
the dependencies listed in within the `package.json` in the local `node_modules`
folder. That is, they'll install both the `dependencies` and `devDependencies`.

Similarly, both Yarn and NPM will do the same thing when doing a production
install.  That is, `yarn install --production` or `npm install --production`.
Here are snippets from both sets of documentation.

Yarn
> Yarn will not install any package listed in `devDependencies` if the
> `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `production`. Use this flag to
> instruct Yarn to ignore `NODE_ENV` and take its production-or-not status from
> this flag instead.

NPM
> With the `--production` flag (or when the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is
> set to `production`), npm will not install modules listed in
> `devDependencies`. To install all modules listed in both `dependencies` and
> `devDependencies` when `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `production`,
> you can use `--production=false.`

This answers my first question:

**Q: What's the difference between dependencies and devDependencies?**

**A: Both dependencies and devDependencies are installed to the local `node_modules`
folder on a `yarn install` or `npm install`, but only dependencies - and not
devDependencies - are installed to the local `node_modules` folder when doing a
`yarn install --production` and `npm install --production`.**

That's good to know, but I wanted to know more. I want to know what happens
when I uneccessarily add modules as dependencies and/or accidentally add
devDependencies that should be dependencies and what the result is to my
production build.

I think the best way to determine these scenarios are with a few example projects.

#### Creating a test project to compare

I really wanted to keep this test framework agnostic, at first I was going to
use a simple node.js server, but there isn't really a build step for that.

In the end I did go with a framework, I tested with Create React App, and I did
this for a few reasons.

1. Create React App is already optimized for production builds. I don't have to
	 worry about webpack code splitting or minimising etc, as all of that logic is
abstracted and has already been optimized.
2. I work a lot with React so I'm familiar with the setup.

After getting setup with `create-react-app` I ran a production build which
returned these results.

```bash
$ yarn build
yarn run v1.22.4
$ react-scripts build
Creating an optimized production build...
Compiled successfully.

File sizes after gzip:

  39.4 KB  build/static/js/2.a7466e6b.chunk.js
  791 B    build/static/js/runtime-main.c4e2e950.js
  659 B    build/static/js/main.2a00e9d5.chunk.js
  547 B    build/static/css/main.5f361e03.chunk.css

The project was built assuming it is hosted at /.
You can control this with the homepage field in your package.json.

The build folder is ready to be deployed.
You may serve it with a static server:

  yarn global add serve
  serve -s build

  bit.ly/CRA-deploy

Done in 4.26s.
```

This gives us the bundle sizes for our production build. I can even serve the
production build locally with `npx serve -s build` and watch the bundles download in the web browser.

Note that in the above image, the light grey size number is the size of the
actual file, where as the darker coloured size is the compressed file size that
got transferred over the network. The compressed sizes differ to the gziped
sizes that the `create-react-app` build script told us, but the actual file
sizes _are_ consistent with the file sizes I see on my file system.

I want to test two cases:
1. What happens when I add a module that should be a `dependency` as
a `devDependency` and;
2. What happens when I add a module that should be a `devDependency` as a `dependeny`.

For the first test, I'm going to add `moment.js` to the project. Moment is a
pretty popular package for parsing, validating, manipulating and formatting
dates. The unpacked module size is 2.79 MB so we should be able to see a
difference in our build bundle sizes.

Firstly I added moment correctly as a actual `dependency`, to see what the build
would look like so we have something to compare it to later.

```bash
Creating an optimized production build...
Compiled successfully.

File sizes after gzip:

  55.79 KB (+16.39 KB)  build/static/js/2.8f81fcde.chunk.js
  791 B                 build/static/js/runtime-main.c4e2e950.js
  703 B (+44 B)         build/static/js/main.55c05814.chunk.js
  547 B                 build/static/css/main.5f361e03.chunk.css
```

Here we can see that adding `moment.js` to our project increased our production
bundle size by 16.39 KB in one chunk, and 44 B in another. This is pretty
consistent with [momentjs.com](https://momentjs.com/) which says the minified
`moment.js` files are 16.7 KB gzipped.

Then I removed `moment.js` from the project and re-ran the production build to reset
it back to stock standard Create React App, before re-adding `moment.js` again as a
`devDependency` this time.

Interestingly, adding moment instead as a `devDependency` returned the exact same result.

```bash
Creating an optimized production build...
Compiled successfully.

File sizes after gzip:

  55.79 KB (+16.39 KB)  build/static/js/2.8f81fcde.chunk.js
  791 B                 build/static/js/runtime-main.c4e2e950.js
  703 B (+42 B)         build/static/js/main.55c05814.chunk.js
  547 B                 build/static/css/main.5f361e03.chunk.css
```

We can also see this in the browser

##### Conclusion

Originally, I was also going to test with something like Typescript or Jest as
well, to see if adding them to either `dependencies` or `devDependencies` made a
difference to the final production build as well. But it's clear to me from the
first test that webpack doesn't care if a module is listed in the `dependencies`
or `devDependencies`.

So I learnt two things today;

**1. `yarn install` and `npm install` will install both the `dependencies` and
`devDependencies` in your project's `package.json` file. While `yarn install
--production` and `npm install --production` will install only the
`dependencies`, and will not install any modules from the `devDependencies`.**

**2. Your production build won't be bloated if you accidentally put modules that
should be only be a development depencency as a dependency or visa versa.
Webpack will only pull in the modules that it's actually using regardless.**

It's clear from the tests above that npm modules installed as `dependencies` and
`devDependencies` don't matter in terms of your production build, as webpack
will still pull in any module it needs for it's production build, regardless of
how to module was installed.

Where it will matter however, if how you perform your production build. If, for
example, you have a CI/CD step that automatically builds your app when you
deploy to your `master branch` on GitHub, and that CI/CD step is installing your
project dependencies with `yarn install --production` or `npm install
--production`, then any `devDependencies` won't be downloaded.

That would be a problem if your app was similar to my test above where the
project uses `moment.js`, even though it's installed as a `devDependency`
because `moment.js` will never be installed. Then, when webpack tries to run
it's build, it will fail because of the missing `moment.js` module.

Other than that, in terms of optimising your production build, modules installed
via a `dependency` or `devDependency` don't really matter. At least when using
the production build in Create React App.

Happy Coding!
