## Introduction

Welcome to the new series of blog posts titled "JavaScript deep dive".

The goal of this series is to understand the programming language JavaScript
just a little bit more, to develop just a little bit more knowledge about how it
works than I knew before.

I work mostly with JavaScript as a FrontEnd web developer right now, and my goal
is to get much more familiar with the langugage. To that end, I want to deep
dive into particular topics that interest me, about how JavaScript works under
the hood in different situations.

I remember reading the book [You Don't Know
JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) by Kyle Simpson a few years ago.
Each chapter seemed to be on a topic that I thought I knew, until I started
reading and realised I didn't really know the topic well at all in depth.

In this series, I hope to re-discover that feeling again, and learn about how
JavaScript works in more depth, as I (hopefully) move to closer mastery.

Here are the topics I want to cover:

- Precision point numbers
- Classes
- Coercion
- Filter(boolean)
- Inheritance
- Prototype

Happy Coding!
