## Introduction

I recently started a new project and I've decided that for this project, I want to
use Typescript as a means to learn. Getting set up with CRA and Typescript is
pretty straight forward, as it just works out of the box. Adding emotion.js for
styling wasn't too hard either, but getting it working with theming took a bit
of confuguring which is what I'll cover here.

What I mean by theming is I want to create a light and dark theme, and have the
user be able to switch between the two.

Without further ado, let's get started. To start a new Create React app project
with TypeScript, you can run:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```

This will download the latest versions of everything Create React App needs to
get your project initialized. After which, you can simply type:

```bash
cd my-app
yarn start
```

And a development server will launch.

That's everything you need to do to get started with Create React App and
TypeScript. If you want to read more or got stuck somewhere, I'd suggest first
reading the [Create React App
documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/).

#### Adding emotion

[Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) is a library designed for
writing css styles with JavaScript which we can use with our React apps. Adding
emotion is easy. Simply run this command in your project root directory:

```bash
yarn add @emotion/core @emotion/styled
```

And you're good to go! Here's an example of what a React component looks like
when styled with emotion:

_Button.tsx_
```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from '@emotion/core'
import styled from '@emotion/styled/macro'

const Button = styled.button`
color: hotpink;
`

export default Button;
```

_App.tsx_
```diff
/** App.tsx */
  import React from 'react';
+ import Button from './Button';
  import logo from './logo.svg';
  import './App.css';

  function App() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <p>
            Edit <code>src/App.tsx</code> and save to reload.
          </p>
+	      <Button>This button is hotpink!</Button>
          <a
            className="App-link"
            href="https://reactjs.org"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            Learn React
          </a>
        </header>
      </div>
    );
  }
  
  export default App;
```

For more TypeScript related information for using emotion with TypeScript, I'd
recommend you checkout the [emotion documentation on typescript](https://emotion.sh/docs/typescript).

If all you want to do is use emotion with your project, then you can stop here.
You're all good to start creating an awesome React app.

If you want to add theming to your project, then you'll also need to follow
these next steps.

#### Adding an emotion theme

First, you need to add the `emotion-theming` library.

```bash
yarn add emotion-theming
```

Then, you need to define your theme. You need to do this in a seperate file so
you can export `styled` using the `CreateStyled` function that `@emotion/styled`
gives you.

_styled.tsx_
```javascript
import { jsx } from '@emotion/core'
import styled, { CreateStyled } from '@emotion/styled'

type Theme = {
  color: {
    primary: string
    positive: string
    negative: string
  }
  // ...
}

const theme: Theme = {
	color: {
		primary: 'hotpink',
		positive: '#00C851',
		negative: '#ff4444',
	},
	// ...
};

export { jsx, theme };
export default styled as CreateStyled<Theme>
```

Now, you can add your theme to your project using the `ThemeProvider` HOC from
`emotion-theming`.

_App.tsx_
```diff
/** App.tsx */
  import React from 'react';
+ import { ThemeProvider } from 'emotion-theming'
+ import { Theme } from './styled'
  import Button from './Button';
  import logo from './logo.svg';
  import './App.css';

  function App() {
    return (
+	   <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
		  <div className="App">
			  <header className="App-header">
				  <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
				  <p>
					  Edit <code>src/App.tsx</code> and save to reload.
				  </p>
				  <Button>This button is hotpink!</Button>
				  <a
					  className="App-link"
					  href="https://reactjs.org"
					  target="_blank"
					  rel="noopener noreferrer"
				  >
					  Learn React
				  </a>
			  </header>
		  </div>
+	  </ThemeProvider>
    );
  }

  export default App;
```

And finally, now you can use your theme in your components!

_Button.tsx_
```diff
  /** @jsx jsx */
  import styled, { jsx } from './styled'

  const Button = styled.button`
- color: hotpink;
+ color: ${(props) => props.theme.colors.primary};
`

  export default Button;
```

## Conclusion

And that's it! You are now able to build our your own theme to use within your
React components. One thing to note is that the [babel-macro](https://emotion.sh/docs/babel-macros) isn't working yet with theming, but updates have been made and are coming in emotion version 11.


Happy Coding!
