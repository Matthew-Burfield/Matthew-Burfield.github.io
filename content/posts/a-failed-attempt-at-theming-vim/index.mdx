**Disclaimer**: If you came here looking for how to create a theme in Vim then
you'll be sorely disappointed. This is not a story about overcoming the odds and
winning in the end. This story does not have a happy ending.

## Introduction

I've only just recently started using Vim as my main editor, moving away from
the safe and comfortable VSCode to editing exclusively in the terminal.

Obviously that means moving away from an IDE - which means you will lose some
functionality from the editor, but for the most part, working from the terminal
has been a pretty nice experience so far as I continue to get used to working
without using the mouse.

One thing that did bother me though, is the syntax highlighting. Syntax
highlighting in VSCode seems to be much more expressive, especially when looking
at `.jsx` files.

Here's a look at a comparison between Vim in the terminal and VSCode using the
one-dark themes.

And conversely, here is the equivalent in Vim

Obviously when it comes to syntax highlighting, everything is personal
preference, but with all the different themes I tried to use in Vim, I always
seemed to like the equivalent in VSCode better.

Naturally this led me down the path of looking into how color themes are made in
Vim and whether I could edit an existing one or create my own.

After much searching around, I stumbled across [this template by Gerardo
Galindez](https://github.com/ggalindezb/vim_colorscheme_template/blob/master/template.vim) which worked pretty well, it has a nice layout and has a list of all the different syntax highlighting groups in Vim, grouped by category.

This was a good starting point. I wanted to reset all the colors in Vim to
nothing so I could then start adding colors one by one and build out my theme,
and this template looked like it would achieve that task.

In Vim, you can load your own color theme by adding your theme (such as the
template above) to the
`~/.vim/colors/` directory (If that directory doesn't exist, you can create
it). Then, in your `~/.vimrc` file, add the line:

```vim
colorscheme my_theme_name
```

Where `my_theme_name` is replaced with whatever you call your theme.

The template above started me down the right track for what I wanted to
accomplish in completely resetting all colors, but it wasn't the complete
picture. Because I had enabled 256 color support, the syntax groups weren't
simply being highlighted with the `ctermfg`, `ctermbg` and `cterm` options, but
were also being highlighted with `guifg`, `guibg` and `gui` as well. Therefore in order to truely reset all syntax highlights, I needed to set those options to
`none` as well.

If you want to read more about those terms, I suggest starting with Vim's
internal help. (I.e. `:h guifg`).

[I created a new template](https://gist.github.com/Matthew-Burfield/7d29195594c9c809b08fdb97df02d682) that incorporates this and now I do have a complete
reset of colors. The text is plain white, while everthing else is plain black.

Now I could slowly start adding colors to each syntax group, and slowly start to
build out the theme I wanted.

This was kind of working until I realised that with only the syntax groups
availabile by default in Vim, I wasn't able to customise language specific
syntax groups. I only really work with a JavaScript and React, so wanted to be
able to customise `.jsx` files.

I started looking at the internals of syntax plugins like
[pangloss/vim-javascript]( https://github.com/pangloss/vim-javascript ) which
I think create new syntax groups using a bunch of regex expressions, and then
map those new syntax groups to the regular syntax groups in Vim so syntax
highlighting works out of the box with other syntax highlighting plugins.

What I tried to do was reference the internally defined syntax groups defined
by `pangloss/vim-javascript` directly. Some of these did actually work, like 
the `jsImport` and `jsExport` groups. However most of them didn't, or at least,
based on the name of the group, it wasn't immediately obvious what the syntax
group should actually change. This led to a lot of setting a color, then
re-sourcing the vimrc in my `.jsx` file, to look at anything that changed.

_An excruciatingly long process_

I'm sure this isn't the most efficient way to create a theme, but by this stage I had pretty much wasted an entire weekend just to get to this point and promptly gave up ðŸ˜….

## Conclusion

I did warn you that this wasn't a story with a happy ending.

My current setup is using the gruvbox light theme and I don't mind it. Maybe
some day I'll revisit creating a theme in Vim, but for now I have better things
to do.

Happy Coding!
