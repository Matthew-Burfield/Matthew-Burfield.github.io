## An introduction

Before jumping straight into the project, it's probably worth giving a quick
overview of what Chingu is and why I wanted to do a project.

I first discovered Chingu in 2016 when I was working through [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
and teaching myself web development. Chingu is a organised project something.
After signing up, they pair you with 3-5 other developers, and as a remotely
distributed team over 6 weeks (a voyage), you build a project together.

The project can be anything and is decided by the team. The purpose of the 6
week voyage is to coordinate with others and finish a project that you can then
add to your portfolio. It's a great way to keep yourself accountable.

3 years ago I did a couple of voyages and got some good experience working with
others. Now, 3 years later, I wanted to build something for fun and thought this
would be a good way to do it.

## My team and our project

I had 5 members on my team, from various countries within the Asia-Pacific region
(Chingu does it's best to group people into similar time-zones). Our first meeting
was about deciding on a project to build.

Having had a couple of friends recently get married, and both of them wanting to
have a wedding registry, but not being able to find a decent one online that fit
their requirements, I put that project idea infront of the group and we all decided
that it would be a good project to build.

We set out some MVP requirements and some stretch goals we could work towards
if we had time.

## Project Requirements

The following user stories were used as requirements for this project.

1. User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can add gifts to my registry

2. User Story: As an authenticated user, I can update the title and description
of my wedding

3. User Story: As a non authenticated user, I can create a new account and login

4. User Story: As a non authenticated user, I can navigate to a unique URL to 
see an existing registry

5. User Story: As a non authenticated user, I can mark a registry gift as "purchased"

## Life in a Voyage

The voyage went for 6 weeks, and each week we called a sprint. The idea of a sprint
comes from the agile methodology where after each sprint you have a working product.
You then spend each sprint iterating over the product, but are able to test and
get feedback after each sprint.

I spent most of this voyage working on the frontend, which was good as one of my
goals was to work on the latest version of React, and get more comfortable working
with hooks.

## Improvements That Can Be Made

Overall we did a pretty good job at getting a solid MVP working. Most of the flows
work really well and the app is fully functional.

The first improvement I would make is with the user authentication. We used auth0
for the app user management which was a good solution since it was quick and easy
to get going. The issue though, is that the login/signup screen is hosted on 
auth0, which means the user gets redirected to another site to login, and then
redirected back one authentication is made, with the session cookie.

The second problem with authentication, is that it all happens on the client side,
so when the user refreshes the page, the server will send all the react code, and
then after that's loaded, the authentication request is sent to auth0. The issue
is that for pages that have a "must be logged in" wrapper, nothing is rendered
until authentication is confirmed, resulting in a longer loading time. I'd love to
update this so all the authentication is done on the server. 

I think for this app to be able to be used in the real world, there would need
to be a few more features, such as integrating with Stripe, or some payment system.

## What I Liked About This Project

I'm really happy with how this project came together. In only 6 weeks we built
a fully functional wedding registry including both an admin portal for managing
the registry itself, and the guest experience for guests to be able to "purchase"
the wedding registry gifts and get some other information about the wedding.

I think the main thing that made this project successful was that our entire
team was involved and staying consistent throughout the whole voyage. Every team
member attended every virtual meeting through out the entire 6 weeks.

## Conclusion

I'm really happy I did this Chingu Voyage. It was a great motivator and kept me
accountable. I also enjoyed working as the PM, organising the tasks for each
member and checking in with everyone indiviually.

I plan to keep working on the wedding registry and get it to a point that it could
be used in the real world.

After that, I'll definitely be back to do another Voyage!

Happy Coding!
